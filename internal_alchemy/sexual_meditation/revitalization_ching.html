<hr>
    <p>The <a href="">White Tigress Manual</a> lists various herbal formulas that the Jade Dragon can use to achieve three goals:
    <ol>
      <li>Increase the size of the Jade Stem</li>
      <li>Acquire more sexual prowess</li>
      <li>Improve the quality and quantity of ejaculation</li>
    </ol>
   <p>The three goals are best achieved by using the <a href="#joyful_dragon">Joyful Dragon Formula</a> in combination with both the <a href="#dragon_ointment">Dragon King Ointment</a> and <a href="#nine_exercises">The Nine Jade Dragon Exercises</a>. After the maximum results are achieved from the Joyful Dragon Formula, the <a href="#dragon_horn_formula">Dragon Horn Formula</a> can be used, but because they share some of the same herbs, the two should never be taken simultaneously.</p>

   <p><i>Note: These are powerful and effective formulae and should only be mixed by a competent herbalist.</i></p>
    </div>
</section>


<section id="joyful_dragon">
    <div class="border"><h2>
      <a href="#joyful_dragon">Joyful Dragon Formula</a>
    </h2>
    <p>The Joyful Dragon formula stimulates blood flow to the penis, thus expanding the corpora cavernosa, stimulating the growth of the bulb of the corpus spongiosum (causing it to lengthen), causing the increased production of semen and the frequency and prolongation of erections, while also encouraging multiple ejaculations. <p>

    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <p>Lengthen the Jade Stem and increase sexual stamina.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>The Dragon King Ointment causes the Jade Stem's skin to attract increased blood flow in the dorsal veins, arteries, and capillaries, thus causing the two corpora cavernosa chambers and the glans penis to swell.</p>

    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <p>Enhance length and girth of the Jade Stem.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">

    <h3>Purpose:</h3>

    </h2>
    <p>In addition to the herbal formulas listed above, a man might wish to take more readily available popular herbs used for stimulating sexual energy and alleviating problems of the prostate: ginseng, yohimbe, and saw palmetto. These herbs will be most effective taken in extract form.
    <h3>Ginseng</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Yohimbe</h3>
    <p>Yohimbe originates from the inner bark of the tree <i>Pausinystalia yohimbe</i>. Yohimbe has three actions that make it useful and powerful as a sexual stimulant:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>It expands the blood vessels in the extremities of the body—the head, hands, feet and genitals—which increases blood flow to the corpus cavernosa</li>
      <li>It inhibits and reduces the effects of hormones that constrict blood vessels, hormones that typically increase as we grow older</li>
      <li>It increases the production of norepinephrine and adrenaline, both of which are essential to both erections and sexual stimulation</li>
      <p>Yohimbe is one of only two substances <a href="">approved by the FDA</a> for the treatment of impotence—the second being Viagra.</p>
    </ol>

      <a href="#strengthening_erection">Strengthening the Erection</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Many men experience difficulty maintaing an erection for a long length of time without constant simulation, or do not always reach full strength. These effects become more serious as  they grow older because the erection becomes diminished in both intensity and duration.</p>
      <p>The first rule is masturbate less frequently. After the age of 30, a man should masturbate once a week, at most 2-3 times.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Masturbate as often as desired, but only to the point of stimulation, not ejaculation. This will greatly increase sexual energy as well as strengthen erections and increase seminal fluid production, while reversing desensitization that might have occured.</li>
        <li>Wear tight underwear so that more blood remains trapped with the Jade Stem during dailing acivities.</li>
        <li>Take either fresh ginger or ginger extract capsules every day. Among ginger's numerous health benefits is an increase in blood circulation to the extremities.</li>
        <li>Stimulate the kundalini gland, located a couple of inches inside the anal orifice. When stimulated it can greatly strengthen erection.</p>
        </ol>
        <p>The best technique for stimulating the kundalini gland is to lie on your back and have your partner insert their middle finger, with the palm of the hand facing down, fully into your anus, and then press down repeatedly with the finger in the rectum. Have your partner tightly grasp the base of the penis and scrotum with the other index finger and thumb. The effects of the erection will be felt more fully if your partner orally stimulates the Jade Stem's head while tapping the kundalini gland.</p>

<section id="enlarging_head">
    <div class="border"><h2>
      <a href="#enlarging_head">Enlarging the Jade Stem's Head</a>
    </h2>
    <p>The width of the Jade Stem's head is what gives your partner the most pleasure and sensation, whether vaginally, anally, or orally. The Stem's head contains the largest majority of the Stem's sensory nerves, making it the most sensitive area for the man; for the woman, the rim of the head induces increased sensation within her orifices.</p>
<p>Therefore, the larger the head (the bottom rim especially), the greater the sensation for both partners.</p>
        <p>There are three primary methods for enlarging the Stem's head:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Soak the Stem's head in warm (not lukewarm or hot) water to increase blood flow. Do this daily for 100 days, and then stop for 30 days before starting again.</li>
          <li>Have your partner grasp and apply pressure to the base of the Stem's shaft and entire scrotum with the index finger and thumb of one hand. She should then orally stimulate the head, using firm suction of her lips and mouths for several secons; this will also help draw blood into the Stem's head. This exercose should be repeated for 3-4 minutes every day for 100 days, and then stopped for 30 days before beginning again.</li>
          <li>The third method is applying the Dragon Collar directly beneath the Stem's head and keeping it there until the erection has subsided. This will help trap blood in the Stem's head for a longer period of time, helping to stretch and expand the head.</li>
        </ol>

      <a href="#enhancing_sexual_energy">Enhancing Sexual Energy</a>
    </h2>
    <p>There are several commonsense actions you can take to ensure peak sexual energy:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Maintain a daily exercise routine.</li>
          <li>Eat healthy foods, especially vegetables and fruits, and voide processed foods or foods containing sugar. Sugar will deplete your sexual energy, and over time completely destroy it.</li>
          <li>Be hygienic. When the body is clean it is far more energetic. Every day apply a cream, lotion, or herbal extract to the entire shaft and head of the Jade Stem and the Dragon Pearls. Creams containing ginseng, aloe vera, and Vitamin E are best.</li>
          <li>Stay away from cigarettes, caffeine and reactreaional drugs. Alcohol will increase sexual desire when consumed moderately, but dull your senses when consumed to the point of drunkenness.</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <p>Less obvious ways to enhance your sexual energy:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Shave the entire pubic and groin area. When the genitals are shaved, it triggers adolescent responses in the body, making you feel younger and much more energetic.</li>
          <li>Have a cup of <a href="#ginseng">American ginseng</a> tea twice a day.</li>
          <li>Every day for 60 days, eat two ounces of crushed walnuts. This will restore sexual energy, strengthen erections, and increase semen quantity. After 60 days, stop ingesting the walnuts for 90 days before beginning the process again.</li>
        </ol>

    </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>While sitting or lying down, take your right thumbnail and press it into the skin below the center of each fingernail of your left hand.</li>
            <li>Reverse the position of your hands and repeat.</li>
            <li>Press each finger 10 times, twice a day.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>These acurpressure points on the fingers calm the kidneys and central nervous system and regulate the seminal ducts.

      <a href="#preventing_premature_ejaculation">Preventing Premature Ejaculation</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you sense your climax is coming too rapidly, apply the following technique to prolong sexual activity:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>While the Jade Stem is erect, place the index finger and thumb of the left hand around the base of the shaft, applying firm pressure with the index finger against the lower part of the underside the Stem.</li>
          <li>With the index finger and thumb of the right hand, sequeeze the tip of the Stem 36 times.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Caution must be taken not to the pinch the tip of the Stem too hard or it might cause bruising. The pressure should be strong enough for you to feel it but light enough not to cause any pain or discomfort.</p>

<section id="semen_quantity_quality">
    <div class="border"><h2>
      <a href="#semen_quantity_quality">Increasing Semen Quantity and Quality</a>
    </h2>
    <p>The parts of man's sexual performance that will most impress a sexual partner are his intensity at climax and the quantity of semen he ejaculates. The more semen a man ejaculates, the more the woman views herself as having fulfilled him. Aside from the herbs and exercises mentioned previously, the following can also be performed to help the body produce more semen:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Soak the Dragon Pearls in cold tap water for 3 minutes. Do this every day for 30 days, then wait 30 days before performing the soak again. Within a year you should be able to double the amount of semen you normally produce, provided you are taking the herbs and doing the exercises previously listed.</li>
          <li>Take a piece of sliced red ginseng every day and place it in your mouth until it completely dissolves.</li>
          <li>Ejaculate only once in every 3 masturbations. The other two times, stop before the sensation of climax occurs and simply relax until the urge to climax disappears.</li>
          <li>Let your sexual partner see you ejaculate. Rather inside her or into a condom, do so on her body or even onto yours. It will create two important psychological responses: first, you will want to ejaculate more semen because you are put in a position of exhibition; second, your partner will want to draw more semen from you. </li>
          <li>For those fond of oral sex, it is advisable to eat fresh cinnamon, licorice root, or pineapple to make the semen taste better. Dairy products and sugar (of which alcohol is based) will make the semen taste bitter or rancid and should be avoided.</li>
        </ol>

      <a href="#virgin_boy">Virgin Boy Training</a>
    </h2>
    <p>For men who want to completely restore and regenerate their sexual energy and fluids, Virgin Boy Training works best—but it can be difficult. This method was used throughout China in martial arts training and various spiritual practices to ensure that the practitioner's energy would be that of a young boy's again.</p>
    <p>The concept is simple: Don't have sex or ejaculate for 100 days.</p>
    <p>For many men, this is difficult in practice. You are advised to practice the acupressure method for <a href="#preventing_nocturnal_emissions">preventing nocturnal emissions</a> every day when undertaking this practice. And it should be noted, you cannot practice the Nine Jade Dragon Exercises during this time.</p>
    <p>The reason for this practice is to restore the semen back to its original healthy and potent condition. If nocturnal emissions do occur, continue practicing but add an extra day to the practice for each nocturnal emission.</p>
    <p>At the end of 100 days, you may resume normal sexual activity. However, you will sense how much energy ejaculation takes from you, so you will find yourself refraining from casual masturbation and sex for at least a few weeks.</p>
