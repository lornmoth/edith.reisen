  <p>In Europe, only Ireland (73%), Poland (1%), Serbia (3%), Spain (11%), and the U.K. (11%) fluoridate any of their water. Most developed countries, including Japan and 97% of the western European population,<a href="https://archive.is/FNwPy">do not consume fluoridated water.</a></p>

  <p>In the U.S., about 70% of public water supplies are fluoridated. This equates to approximately 185 million people, which is <a href="http://archive.is/khl7a">over half</a> the number of people drinking artificially fluoridated water worldwide. Some countries have areas with high natural fluoride levels in the water. These include India, China and parts of Africa. In these countries measures are being taken to <a href="http://archive.is/rTveG">remove the fluoride</a> because of the <a href="flouride_toxicity.html">health problems</a> that fluoride can cause.</p>

  <p>For the U.S. to justify its water flouridation program, it requires strong medical evidence of its benefits, of its margin of safety to the wide populace.  Instead we'll see there is no medical evidence for water flouridation's benefits, there is no margin of safey and that flouride is instead highly harmful to the dosed population.</p>

  </h2>
      <h3>1. Only chemical added to water as medical treatment</h3>
        <p>Fluoride is the only chemical added to water for the purpose of medical treatment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <a href="https://archive.is/o/9Aznh/www.fluoridealert.org/uploads/fluoride_drug.pdf">classifies fluoride as a drug when used to prevent or mitigate disease,</a> not a nutrient. Adding fluoride to water for the sole purpose of preventing tooth decay (a non-waterborne disease) is a form of medical treatment. Flouride is the only water treatment chemicals that is not added to improve the water’s quality or safety.</p>

      <h3>2. Violates Medical Ethic and Human Right of Informed Consent</h3>
      <p><a href="http://archive.is/n04Fk">Informed consent</a> requires that doctors must inform the patient of a medicine's benefits, side effects and alternatives and then allow the patient to decide whether or not to take the medicine. Informed consent is a bedrock principle of <a href="http://archive.is/n04Fk">Medical Ethics</a> and a <a href="https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168007cf98">European Human Rights Convention (Article 5)</a>. Europe has largely ruled against water fluoridation because it is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180409042553/https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168007cf98">violation informed consent,</a> by forcing people to take a medicine irrespective of their consent.</p>

      <h3>3. The dose cannot be controlled</h4>
      <p>Despite flouride's toxicity, water flouridation is based on the premise that unregulated and forced dosing can be good for everybody, irrespective of their age, health, and nutritional status. Adding flouride to water thus forces it on everyone in the community, including:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><a href="http://archive.is/GWSAG">bottle-fed babies</a> - despite the recommendation that infants should not consume fluoridated water.</li>
        <li><a href="http://archive.is/J4RCL">individuals with poor kidney function</a> - despite their impaired ability to excrete fluoride and heightened risk for fluoride-induced bone damage.</li>
        <li><a href="http://archive.is/JL8yp">individuals with iodine deficiency</a> - despite  the research demonstrating that the <a href="flouride_toxicity.html#iq">neurological damage caused by flouride</a> is amplified such that at even low levels of fluoride exposure are damaging.</li>
        <li><a href="http://archive.is/Hn5sF">individuals with deficiencies of calcium, vitamin C, and/or vitamin D</a> - despite the research demonstrating that <a href="flouride_toxicity.html#body">fluoride’s toxic effects on bone tissue</a> are amplified in these individuals.</li>
        <li>individuals who drink large quantities of water, including athletes, manual laborers, and those with <a href="http://archive.is/YOBz6">polydipsia</a> - who will receive a disproportionate dose than the intended average.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is no other example of a medicine administered so recklessly.</p>
